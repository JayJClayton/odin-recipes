    <img src="../images/scalloped1.webp">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Does it get any better than warm scaplloped potatoes on a cold day after a long day of work?</p>
    <p>This dish pairs best with ham and asparagus; some fresh, soft rolls as well.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3 pounds white potatoes sliced about ⅛” thick</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce, melt butter, onion and garlic over medium low heat. Cook until onion is softened, about 3 minutes.
        Add flour and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Combine milk and broth. Add a small amount at a time whisking to thicken. The mixture will become
        very thick, continue adding a little bit of liquid at a time whisking until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once all of the liquid has been added, bring to a boil over medium heat while continuing to whisk. Stir in salt and
        pepper and let boil 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9″x13″ baking dish. Place ⅓ of the potatoes in the bottom and season with salt and pepper. Pour ⅓ of the cream
        sauce sauce over top.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers ending with cream sauce. Cover and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and bake for an additional 35-45 minutes or until golden brown and potatoes are tender. Broil for 3-4 minutes to
        obtain a golden top.</li>
        <li>Allow to rest for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
