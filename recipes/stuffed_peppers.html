    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400° F and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly wash the bell pepper and pat the excess moisture with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Carefully slice each bell pepper halfway, through the stems.</li>
            <li>Discard the ribs and seeds, and place them on the prepared baking tray. Spray with a bit of cooking oil spray and
            sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 8-10 minute.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic, sauté until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, beans, and corn. Add red pepper flakes, ground cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper, cook stirring
            constantly for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the quinoa and broth, and reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer until quinoa is cooked for about 12-15
            minutes.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove from the heat and carefully spoon the mixture into the roasted peppers.</li>
            <li>Generously sprinkle shredded cheese on top, then place back into the oven and cook for 6-8 minutes (until cheese is
            melted and peppers are tender).</li>
            <li>Once done, remove from the oven, garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley. Serve with your favorite toppings and enjoy.</li>
